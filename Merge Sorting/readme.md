This version of the merge sort algorithm works as follows:

    1.The function first checks if the length of the input array is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the function simply returns the array, as a single element array is already considered sorted.

    2.If the array has more than one element, the function finds the middle index of the array by dividing the length of the array by 2. Then it creates two sub-arrays by slicing the original array - one from the start to the middle index, and the other from the middle index to the end.

    3.The function recursively calls itself on the two sub-arrays, and assigns the returned values to the variables "left" and "right". This step will continue until all the sub-arrays have only one element.

    4.Once all the sub-arrays have been reduced to single element arrays, the function uses the python built-in sorted() function to merge and sort the two sub-arrays.

    5.The function then returns the merged and sorted sub-arrays.

    6.Finally the original array will be sorted after the recursion.

    7.The result is printed.

This version of merge sort uses the sorted() function, which is a built-in python function that sorts a list in ascending order. It eliminates the need to implement the merge step of the algorithm separately, making the code more concise.
