One-Time Pad (OTP) cipher is a symmetric key encryption method that uses a unique, random key for each plaintext message to be encrypted. The key must be as long as the plaintext message and must be used only once. The encryption process involves XOR'ing each plaintext bit with the corresponding key bit. This results in a ciphertext that is completely random and has no patterns, making it extremely secure if used correctly. However, the key distribution and management can be a challenge in practical implementation.
